C++ code for making a terminal menu that lets you make Queue, Stack, Singly linked list, doubly linked list.
each have their own functions(to check functions for each, check the .h files)

class decleration in .h files
class description in .pp files

** it is assumed that user will not put alphabet letters OR numbers too big for int in the input **

_programRunner.bat (only for windows CMD) for making the .o files and the final .exe output of the program
_removeProgram.bat (only for windows CMD) for removing files made by _programRunner in order to change code


This is the first project i wrote on C++ for my end-of-semester project for data structure class.
implementing a "console.cpp" might've been a good idea but i had already spent too much time on this
and the main.cpp itself can be improved upon. the rest of the code can also be further optimized.

hopefully people find this code useful in case if they got the same sort of project assigned to them.
thank u for reading this
